## Description

Alphabet Soup, an imaginary venture capitalist firm, has asked us to create a binary classifier model which will predict whether an applicant will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We are given a csv file with data on whether an applicant was successful and more information. We are asked to create multiple models using this csv to get the best predictions.

## Installation Guide

If running in Google Colab, the Tensorflow and Keras will already be installed. If running using Jupyter Notebook, Tensorflow2 will need to be installed. Keras will be installed with Tensorflow2. Please run the following command if using Jupyter Notebook:
```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

## Usage

To run application, clone this repository and run individual cells in google colab.

## Structure of Repository

This repository contains a .ipynb file which was generated using Google Colab. The .ipynb file used data from the applicants_data.csv file for the models. The HDF5Models folder contains the original model and the additional models that were generated and saved in the .ipynb file.
